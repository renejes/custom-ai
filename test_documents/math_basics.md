# Basic Mathematics for 5th Grade

## Addition and Subtraction

### What is Addition?

Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to get a total or sum. The symbol used for addition is "+".

**Example:**
- 5 + 3 = 8
- 12 + 7 = 19

### What is Subtraction?

Subtraction is the process of taking one number away from another. The symbol used for subtraction is "-".

**Example:**
- 10 - 4 = 6
- 15 - 8 = 7

## Multiplication

Multiplication is repeated addition. When we multiply, we add a number to itself multiple times. The symbol used is "×" or "*".

**Example:**
- 4 × 3 = 12 (which is the same as 4 + 4 + 4)
- 6 × 5 = 30

### Multiplication Table (1-10)

It's helpful to memorize multiplication tables. Here are some key ones:

- 2 × 2 = 4
- 3 × 3 = 9
- 4 × 4 = 16
- 5 × 5 = 25
- 6 × 6 = 36
- 7 × 7 = 49
- 8 × 8 = 64
- 9 × 9 = 81
- 10 × 10 = 100

## Division

Division is the opposite of multiplication. It's the process of splitting a number into equal parts. The symbol used is "÷" or "/".

**Example:**
- 12 ÷ 3 = 4 (12 split into 3 equal parts gives 4 in each part)
- 20 ÷ 5 = 4

## Fractions

A fraction represents a part of a whole. It has two parts:
- **Numerator**: The top number (how many parts we have)
- **Denominator**: The bottom number (total number of equal parts)

**Example:**
- 1/2 (one half)
- 3/4 (three quarters)
- 2/3 (two thirds)

### Adding Fractions

To add fractions with the same denominator, add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.

**Example:**
- 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4
- 1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5

## Decimals

Decimals are another way to represent parts of a whole. They use a decimal point.

**Example:**
- 0.5 = 1/2
- 0.25 = 1/4
- 0.75 = 3/4

### Converting Fractions to Decimals

Divide the numerator by the denominator:
- 1/2 = 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5
- 1/4 = 1 ÷ 4 = 0.25
- 3/4 = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75

## Word Problems

Math isn't just about numbers - it helps us solve real-world problems!

**Example 1:**
Sarah has 12 apples. She gives 5 to her friend. How many does she have left?
- Answer: 12 - 5 = 7 apples

**Example 2:**
A box contains 6 chocolates. If you have 4 boxes, how many chocolates do you have in total?
- Answer: 6 × 4 = 24 chocolates

**Example 3:**
A pizza is cut into 8 equal slices. If you eat 3 slices, what fraction of the pizza did you eat?
- Answer: 3/8 of the pizza

## Practice Tips

1. Practice multiplication tables daily
2. Draw pictures to help visualize word problems
3. Check your work by doing the opposite operation
4. Don't be afraid to use your fingers or objects to count
5. Ask questions when you don't understand

## Conclusion

Mathematics is a fundamental skill that helps us in everyday life. Keep practicing, and you'll get better every day!
